            **Object:** Score the most points by crossing off numbers in colored rows
            
            **Game Components:**
            - 6 dice: 4 colored (red, yellow, green, blue) + 2 white
            - Score pads with 4 colored number rows
            - Each player gets their own score sheet
            
            **The Rows:**
            - **Red & Yellow:** Numbers 2-12 (left to right)
            - **Green & Blue:** Numbers 12-2 (right to left)
            - Must cross off numbers from left to right in each row

            1. Active player rolls all 6 dice
            2. **Everyone can use:** Sum of both white dice
            3. **Active player only:** Can also use one white + one colored die
            4. Cross off the corresponding number in the matching colored row
            
            **Important Rules:**
            - Numbers must be crossed off from **left to right** in each row
            - You can skip numbers, but can't go back to earlier numbers
            - You don't have to cross off anything if you don't want to
            
            **Failed Throws:**
            - If you can't or don't want to cross off any numbers, mark a penalty box
            - 4 penalty marks = game ends immediately

            ### How to Lock a Row
            
            **Requirements:**
            - Must have at least 5 numbers crossed off in the row
            - Must cross off the rightmost number (12 for red/yellow, 2 for green/blue)
            - Can only lock using a colored die (not white dice sum)
            
            **What Happens When Locked:**
            - Draw an X in the lock symbol at the end of the row
            - Remove that colored die from the game for all players
            - No one can cross off more numbers in that row
            - You get points for the lock symbol as if it's another crossed number
            
            **Strategic Importance:**
            - Locking denies other players access to that color
            - Consider timing - lock too early and you limit your own scoring
            - Lock too late and someone else might lock it first

            ### Strategic Considerations
            
            **Early Game:**
            - Focus on the middle numbers (6-8) - they come up most often
            - Don't rush to cross off numbers - wait for good opportunities
            - Consider which rows other players are working on
            
            **Mid Game:**
            - Start thinking about which rows you can realistically complete
            - Watch for locking opportunities (need 5+ numbers crossed)
            - Balance between advancing your own rows and blocking others
            
            **Late Game:**
            - Focus on your strongest rows
            - Consider defensive locking to prevent others from scoring
            - Be careful about penalty marks - they can end the game
            
            **Advanced Tips:**
            - High numbers (10-12) and low numbers (2-4) are harder to get
            - Green and blue rows (12‚Üí2) often score fewer points
            - Sometimes it's better to take a penalty than cross off a bad number
